- N8N will start with [creating and updating nodes for n8n](https://n8n.io/integrations)
  - They’ve specifically asked for a Discord node we can use during the fellowship
  - Get experience working with many different APIs and services
  - There’s over 100 nodes!
  - You’ll have plenty of examples to work from
  - Documented guides to creating nodes
- Then it will expand to contributing to the n8n UI (pictured above)
- Interested in having fellows document and test as well
