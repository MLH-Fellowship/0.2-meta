- All the work here is for the core [Docsify codebase](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/)
- Here are some example of GitHub issues theyâ€™ve saved for fellows:
  - [Migrate to Webpack](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/issues/1168)
  - [Move to LESS or SASS](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/issues/1167)
  - [CLI Starter Pack](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/issues/1169)
  - [Markdown Formatting](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/issues/1166)
  - [Dark Mode](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/issues/1092)
- Seems like a good opportunity to have a real influence on the product
- They are interested in creating a test suite as well!
