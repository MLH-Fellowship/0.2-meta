- The primary project here will be the [Babel CodeSandbox](https://github.com/babel/sandboxes)
  - See a [demo here](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/babel/sandboxes)
  - This is a [react web application](https://github.com/babel/sandboxes/blob/master/package.json)
  - No compiler experience needed!
- Open to accepting Babel core contributors
  - In any case, I recommend reading [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).
