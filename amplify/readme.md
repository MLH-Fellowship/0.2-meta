- The projects here will be both the [CLI](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli) and [JS SDK](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js). 
  - For an example of some CLI issues, see [this tag](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement+label%3Agood-first-issue)
  - SDK specific issues to come later
- React Native experience is a bonus here. 
  - You may potentially work on the iOS and Android portions.
- They mentioned a combination of working on open source issues, with the potential to create full features.
- Good opportunity to see how open source works within a company like Amazon
